  `My dearest ${userName}, you are the kind of peace that cannot be found on silent shores or in empty rooms, for those are merely the absence of noise. 🌿  Your peace is a active, radiant calm that settles in my bones—the quiet certainty in your voice, the gentle understanding in your eyes, the way my entire being exhales when I am with you, as if I have finally come home after a long journey.💖`,
  `${userName}, you are the kind of beautiful that cannot be measured by mirrors 
because mirrors only capture faces,
while your beauty lives in your soul, your laughter, and the way the world feels softer when you walk into it. ✨

You are loved more than words can carry 
not just in the easy moments, but in the quiet ones,
the stormy ones, the ordinary ones.
You are loved in every heartbeat,
in every thought that drifts back to you,
in every tomorrow I dream of with you in it. 💖

You are not just beautiful 
you are the reason beauty exists in my eyes.
And you are not just loved 
you are the reason I have learned what true love feels like. 🌹
